# Plan 30. Good trends (uttama gati)

Uttama means good, gati means movement. Good tendencies appear spontaneously in a player if he moves in harmony with the laws of the macrocosm. As long as it vibrates on the lower three planes, these tendencies do not develop. Their growth only begins here in the fourth chakra, as it requires a certain degree of inner balance to be achieved.

It is the state of balance that allows the player to tune in unison with the cosmic rhythm. Good trends are moving towards finer and finer tuning.

The heart and breath play an important role at the level of the fourth chakra. Getting on the cell "good tendencies", the player gains control over the frequency of the heartbeat and the manner of breathing. Thus, good tendencies help to stabilize the progress made in the development of the fourth chakra, and breathing is directly related to the manifestation of good tendencies.

Each change in the direction of movement (tendency) is reflected in the state of prana - the vital or mental energy of the body. On the material level, this manifests itself as a change in the manner of breathing. Wrong manner brings direct harm to the body. That is, the distortion of the respiratory rhythm simultaneously generates unfavorable vibrations of psychic energy. Good tendencies help the player maintain the right vibes. These tendencies can be identified by observing a person's breathing pattern.

Actions that bring the player closer and closer to life in harmony with the planetary and cosmic cycles serve as the best of good tendencies. Begin by observing the changes that take place in you at dawn and dusk. Get up in the morning when it is still dark, take a shower and change into clean clothes for morning meditation. Other good trends include moving to a vegetarian diet, practicing hatha yoga asanas, learning how to control the breath (see also comments on boxes 38, prana, 39, apana, and 40, vyana), intermittent fasting, conscious the study of spiritual scriptures, as well as all the virtues mentioned in the Leela game.

The practice of good tendencies helps the player to stabilize his life so that it develops rhythmically in a positive direction, free from the energy-dissipating influences of the lower centers.
