# Plan 4. Greed (lobha)

Due to the sense of separation that occurs in every being born, the player begins to seek satisfaction. In order to perform any function in this world, the player must first ensure that their physical needs are met. To participate in the game, he must eat, have a place to rest, clothes. Material survival is the main concern of a player who is at the level of the first chakra.

When the player mixes their sense of dissatisfaction with the need for material survival, greed appears. Even having received everything necessary for life, he still feels empty. All he has learned is to maintain his physical existence. Now he begins to use these basic survival skills to acquire more and more material goods in the hope of achieving satisfaction. However, the more he acquires, the stronger his desire for acquisition becomes. His sense of emptiness reaches the level of panic, his actions become more and more reckless. The legend of King Midas and his 'golden touch' is a classic example of the consequences of greed. This desire for material well-being is also the root cause of all wars.

Greed comes from insecurity, and insecurity comes from a misidentification of the self. If the player does not believe in God, he does not believe in providence either. The cage of greed is the tail of the snake of jealousy. Greed makes the player nearsighted. He does not understand that greed is ultimately meaningless. Sooner or later, all material goods remain behind the threshold: either when we give them up of our own free will, or when death comes. However, greed can also be a virtue on the path of spiritual growth if a person becomes greedy for spiritual experience, knowledge and love.

A player who enters the field of greed opens the gates of his consciousness to maya, anger and all other problems of the first chakra.

The symbol for four is a square representing four dimensions and four cardinal points. The number four symbolizes the earth element. Being a representative of the family of even numbers, the four tends to completeness. The desire for perfection on the material plane, taken to the limit, turns into greed. In Vedic numerology, the number four is ruled by Rahu, the northern lunar node, also known as the Dragon's Head. In Western numerology, this number is ruled by Uranus.
