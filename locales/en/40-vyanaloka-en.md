# Plan 40. Vyana-loka

Vyana takes pranic energy in the lungs and distributes it to all body systems. This vital energy is responsible for the flow of blood, the secretion of the glands, the up and down movements of the body, and the opening and closing of the eyelids. Vyana carries the oxygen in the blood through the capillary system. Oxygen and pranic energy are absorbed into the tissues and waste is expelled into the blood. This blood flows back into the venous system via vyana, which carries this contaminated waste blood back to the heart and lungs. Vyana is also responsible for perspiration. Sweat is released not in any specific places, but through every pore of our body. Prana, which is the life energy in the region of the lungs, cannot do this work; the same applies to apana, which serves to expel in the lower part of the body. Sweat cannot move on its own, it is driven by vyana, which is present throughout the body and plays an important role in maintaining chemical balance through the processes of blood circulation, sweating and coughing.
