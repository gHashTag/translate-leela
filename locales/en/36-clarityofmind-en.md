# Plan 36. Clarity of mind (svaccha)

Clarity of mind is the light that fills the player as they leave the fourth level to enter the fifth, where the human becomes Human. In Sanskrit, the word svaccha means "pure, clear, transparent." This transparency is the result of the purification process the player goes through in the naraka loka.

Transparency means no obstruction to light. When all doubts are cleared, the veil of blind intellect dissolves and is replaced by the pure and powerful light of inner sensation. The intellectual understanding that dominates the first three centers is leaving the scene. Here, reasoning is seen as a defect, a disease of consciousness. When consciousness identifies itself with understanding, it suffers from the disease of the rationality, the chains of the intellect. Devotion and faith help to overcome this state, and the player enters the level of Being.

Entering the svaccha field, the player becomes pure and transparent. He was overcome by doubts, due to which he strayed from the path of true religiosity or ended up in purgatory. But this experience gave him an understanding of sudharma. He developed good tendencies and sanctified his life. He has visited the planes of aroma and taste and is now ready to join the upward flow of energy that takes him to the fifth chakra.
