# Notes

## Dharma

an internal law inherent in all the phenomena of this world, supporting its integrity. This is not just a set of beliefs that have nothing to do with reality, but principles that serve as the basis for a harmonious and prosperous life. This is practical teaching. The word comes from the Sanskrit root dhar, which means "to support, bind together."

## Vedas

divine, perfect knowledge, omnipresent and sustaining the entire manifest world. This knowledge was obtained by rishis (saints, seers, adepts of yoga) in the state of samadhi. This knowledge is found in four scriptures:

1. Rigveda,

2. Yajurveda,

3. Samaveda,

4. Atharvaveda.

Each Veda consists of three parts: Samhita - a collection of hymns or mantras.

Brahmanas, which contain instructions for the use of various mantras and ceremonies. Dedicated mainly to rituals, they also contain many instructive stories, philosophical observations and profound ideas.

The Upanishads are philosophical treatises based on the interpretation of knowledge left by those Rishis to whom this knowledge was revealed.

## Shruti

streams of cosmic vibrations that fill space and have magical powers. They contain the knowledge of the order in which the energies of this world were set in motion at its creation, and of how this order is maintained by the Cosmic Consciousness. The Vedas are Shruti.

## Smriti

practical application of divine knowledge and laws inherent in objects and phenomena of the created world. These treatises contain the laws that make our life divine. There are many Smritis, of which four are recognized as the main ones:

1. Manu-smriti,

2. Yajnavalkya-smriti,

3. Sankhya-smriti,

4. Parasara-smriti.

The Vedas are Shruti and all the books discussing the various points of Dharma are Smriti. These books form the foundation of the Hindu tradition laid down by the ancient seers.

## Puranas

followed by Shruti and Smriti. They illustrate the philosophical teachings set forth in the Vedas, on the example of specific cases and historical facts. The wealth of allegories and metaphors inherent in the style of the Puranas makes it possible to explain the highest philosophical truths in simple human words. For this reason, the Puranas are also called the "fifth Veda".

## Yoga

literally means "to connect, unite, bind". It is a science dedicated to inner growth, bringing peace and developing the ability to stop the constant fluctuations and changes in the workings of the mind, which are the main cause of human suffering. It makes it possible to rise above the sensual level to the spheres of habitual concentration, undivided attention, eternal peace and enlightenment. There are many schools, each of which offers its own ways and methods of improving the body and psyche. Among the general goals of yoga schools, one can note the unification of the solar and lunar principles, control over the autonomic nervous system, etc. In general, yoga can be divided into three large areas:

1. Karma yoga - the yoga of selfless action.

2. Jnana yoga - the yoga of stopping mental fluctuations through negation, leading to absolute truth.

3. Bhakti yoga - the yoga of devotion, love and self-giving.

Among the famous schools of yoga are the following:

- Raja yoga - yoga of the eightfold path (yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi).

Hatha yoga is yoga that trains the senses by working with the body. This practice helps to achieve the goals outlined by Raja Yoga.

- Nada yoga - yoga, working with the sounds of the inner world.

- Laya yoga - dissolution in the flow of cosmic vibrations; also known as kriya yoga and kundalini yoga.

## Vedanta

a philosophical doctrine, also called uttara-mimamsa and currently dominant in Hindu thought. Vedanta is concerned with the study of the nature of the Self and the distinction between the real and the unreal. It points to the unity behind the diversity of objects and phenomena, and gives knowledge of the true nature of things. Vedanta teaches how, from the thought of an individual "I", which seems to be separate from the Higher "Self", one can come to an understanding of the fundamental unity of the first and second, that all "I" are part of the One Great "I", Brahman. The Vedanta says that a person can achieve unity with Him and, moreover, understand that he is and always has been the Cosmic Consciousness, separated from himself by a veil of illusion. This is the science of the "I" that exists outside of qualities, proclaiming the principle "You are That (the Great One "I")".

## Sankhya

description of the creation of the world. The doctrine of the evolution of the manifested world.

## Shloka

Sanskrit stanza.

## Karma Yoga

the yoga of selfless action (karma means "action"). Actions include everything that an individual does from the moment of birth to death. The player, attached to his actions, uses any means to achieve his goals and, blinded by selfishness, harms others. The one who is not subject to such attachment, performs his actions insofar as they are inevitable; he follows his karma with detached interest and never resorts to false means. Karma done by the right means harms no one and is in accordance with the laws of Dharma. Dharma is the law inherent in the player who performs karma according to the tendencies of his mind.
