# Plan 16. Jealousy (dvesha)

He becomes suspicious of other people when their actions are at odds with his idea of himself. In love relationships, he becomes jealous and fears infidelity. His doubts grow and soon his energy returns to the first chakra, where he is caught in the web of greed. Nurtured by self-doubt, jealousy bears the fruit of a loss of a sense of security, and this is the main feature characteristic of the first chakra. Lack of self-confidence also leads to self-hatred, which is then projected onto the burden as dislike towards others.

To regain self-confidence, the player will now have to go through the experience of the first chakra, where they can deal with its causes and raise their vibrations.
