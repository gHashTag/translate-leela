# Short description

Life is a game in which each of us plays a role. This game in India is called Lila, and our Higher Self plays it, creating the whole world of names and forms. Before us is the working model of this Game, created in ancient times and has come down to us through Harish Johari (translation: Sergey Lakatosh), an expert and keeper of the Indian mystical tradition. Yogis who explored the labyrinths of human consciousness established the existence of 72 primordial states of being. These states correspond to the cells of Lila's playing board, the "periodic system of the elements of consciousness." Within these states, each player acts in accordance with his karma, and the game ends only when the player fully penetrates into its meaning, having reached the Cosmic Consciousness. The player rolls the die, allowing the forces of karma to determine their next position on the board. He passes through the various planes of existence, ascending the arrows and descending with the snakes, seeking to comprehend the intention of his Higher Self wherever he goes.

If this is your first time encountering this game, take it seriously. The more respectful you are to the game, the stronger your practice will be. Reverence for the purpose and means of development is necessary for any spiritual growth, and this game is no exception.

The game must be over. Having entered the game, you need to get out of it, merging with the Cosmic consciousness. If you quit playing and stay on some field, then… do you really want to stop progressing at that level? Life goes on, and you will still remain on the same field. That is why the game is worth playing to the end.

The playing field is divided into 8 rows of 9 cells each, for a total of 72 cells.

Only registered users can join the game.

An item belonging to the player acts as a token on the playing field, closely linking you to the game.

The player starts the game from cell number 1. To "enter" the game (move across the playing field), the player must roll a "6" on the die. An infinite number of attempts are given to throw a six. When a "6" is rolled, the player moves to cell 6.

Each cell has its own description, which characterizes the current position of the player and his life situation. The player must describe his experiences of this situation and his thoughts after each move.

The player's chip moves across the playing field sequentially, by cells, as the cell numbers increase. The chip moves to the number of cells that fell on the die for the last time. When hitting a cell with the beginning of an arrow, the chip moves along the arrow up to the cell with the end of the arrow. When hitting a cell with a snake's head, the token moves along the snake down to the cell with the snake's tail.

When the player has already “entered” the game (already at least stood on cell No. 6), when a “6” rolls on the die, after moving the chip, the player must roll the die again (the move is not considered completed). If a player rolls THREE or more times "6" in a turn, he must roll the die until he rolls a number other than "6"; after that, the player's chip returns to the cell from which this move was started, and advances by the number that fell last on the die, ending the move.

The goal of the game (and its end) is to hit cell 68.
