# Plan 60 Positive Intelligence (Subuddhi)

Subuddhi is the right understanding that comes only with the attainment of the plane of reality. After the player has reached Satya Loka, his consciousness becomes perfect and free from duality, and he comprehends the Divine in all forms and phenomena of this world. This consciousness is subuddhi.

As long as the player is in the body, the intellect plays its role. He recognizes, highlights and evaluates. In the seventh chakra, these value judgments no longer refer to the outside world, but are directed inward to discern the nature of the player's inner reality. Each judgment produces a change in the chemical processes of the body. These states are known as feelings.

When a player reaches Cosmic Consciousness, their symbol on the game board (which represents their body) loses its meaning. But until he reaches field 68, the four aspects of consciousness - buddhi, manas, chitta and ahamkara - continue to work. Ahamkara in its negative manifestation becomes selfishness. Buddhi also takes on positive and negative forms. The chitta remains in constant action and interacts with the three gunas.

Until the player has reached the plane of reality, buddhi is not a self-existing phenomenon. The same is true for ahamkara. After the experience of samadhi received in the seventh chakra, and the realization arising from the direct perception of the essence of phenomena, buddhi begins to analyze the experience. And here both positive and negative directions are possible.

Positive vibrations of subuddhi are achieved by following the path of Dharma - on the cell of Dharma, where the arrow begins, leading to this plane. Positive intelligence combined with the player's Dharma flow are two of the most powerful tools in the game to assist the player in their quest for liberation.
