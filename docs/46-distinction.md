# Plan 46 Discrimination (Viveka)

Everything that exists in the phenomenal world is not reality. Objects of perception change over time, they develop, grow and collapse. But these objects of sensory perception create a complete illusion of reality. A person attaches great importance to the objective world and develops a desire to identify with objects of sense perception. Viveka or discrimination is the power that saves him from falling into the desire for material attachment. This is the voice of the player's inner wisdom, which allows him to distinguish the subtle from the gross, to see the noumenon in every phenomenon.

Viveca could not appear in the game earlier. The player can get here only by passing through the field of correct knowledge (45). If the player hits the arrow of right knowledge, he immediately ascends to the plane of cosmic good. Otherwise, he has to resort to the faculty of discrimination in order to determine the further course of the game.

The basic elements of the world of phenomena are at levels up to the fifth chakra. These are the building blocks that form the basis for all gross manifestations. The presence of these elements determines the vibrational level of the player as long as his actions come from these chakras. But the sixth chakra is outside of these elements. Now the manifested maya only slightly affects the player's consciousness.

When a player enters the field of discernment, they are immediately transported to the plane of happiness located in the seventh chakra. In the seventh chakra, the player is beyond all kinds of violence, which is the cause of true happiness. But the sixth chakra is still here, and discrimination is needed here. The sixth chakra is traditionally called the "third eye". Our two eyes see only what exists, what was in the past and what is in the present. And the "third eye" gives the power to discern future opportunities in the game, and this is one of the valuable properties of the sixth chakra: the ability to penetrate into the future. And this is not a fantasy, but a direct perception of what will happen.

Viveka discrimination is not something that develops in us in one fleeting lifetime. It uses the experience accumulated by generations of large masses of people and contained in the collective unconscious. Thus, the player has at his disposal a repository of experience, which is now at a conscious level.

Discrimination is the teacher that sits at the top of every player's head (the seventh chakra) and guides them through life. The player can circumvent social and political laws, but escaping the voice of Viveca is ultimately impossible.

Until the player reaches the sixth chakra, the word "discrimination" means little to them. But the passage through the sixth chakra is determined by the fall of the dice of karma and the promptings of the inner voice of Viveka.
