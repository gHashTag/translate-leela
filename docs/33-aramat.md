# Plan 33. Plan of fragrances (gandha-loka)

Gandha means "smell" and the sense of smell is associated with the earth element and the physical plane. However, when the player reaches the fourth level, the nature of sensory perceptions is transformed, becoming a symbolic expression of the Divine, carrying a powerful emotional charge. Following their sudharma, devotees offer fragrances to the deities in the form of flowers or incense. Thus, the fourth chakra includes the plane of aromas, or Gandha Loka.

In the first chakra, the player is attracted to the smell of alcohol or gasoline. In the second, it is stimulated by various synthetic mixtures with a strong odor. The third chakra is also dominated by a fascination with similar artificial smells, but much more expensive. Rising to the plane of balance, the player realizes the futility of everything artificial and avoids exciting unnatural aromas.

Here, in Gandha Loka, he tastes the divine aromas while meditating. The evolution of energy results in changes at the chemical level in the player's body, and the player's body stops emitting unpleasant odors, emitting instead an odor similar to that of lotus flowers or sandalwood.

In order to develop understanding, people involved in spiritual practice are encouraged to stop using artificial body fragrances in order to recognize their natural smell. When the bad smell from the body disappears, when neither excrement, nor sweat, nor breath carry a bad smell anymore, this means that the energy of a person has overcome the third chakra and entered the Gandha Loka - the plane of aromas. Here there are only divine smells. The player cleans his system of bad smells once and for all.
