# Plan 6. Delusion (moha)

The word moha in Sanskrit means 'attachment'. This attachment is the cause of the slavish bondage that leads the player to be born and reborn again and again in the world of phenomena. The scriptures say that there are four types of possession that bring the individual consciousness into a downward flow of energy and are obstacles to spiritual growth.

This:

1. kama (desires, sensuality),

2. krodha (anger, aggression, violence),

3. lobha (greed, dissatisfaction),

4. moha (attachment, illusion).

If illusion, maya, is the world of appearances itself, then delusion is attachment to the world of appearances as the only possible manifestation of reality. Delusion clouds the mind, making it impossible to comprehend the truth. Delusion is a product of the absence of real religiosity (religiosity here means not following some code of conduct and morality (ethics), but living in harmony with the laws of the universe). 'What must be accepted is the Dharma' is an ancient Sanskrit saying. Dharma is the nature, essence, truth of the existence of the world of phenomena. When a player does not follow the laws of his own nature, which are above all illusions and delusions, he begins to sink into moha. The only thing to understand is that existence is a game. With this realization, the delusion that the player himself directs his existence disappears. And with the disappearance of delusion, negative karma also disappears.

The delusion is the first square that the player lands on after rolling the six needed to enter the game. Having entered the game, the player accepts his temporary dependence on material realities. After the player is born, he is bound by the circumstances of space and time. The reality of this moment is understood as the reality of all moments. Change seems impossible. The player is confused.

No matter how he got here, as a result of being born or falling along the snake of the lack of real religiosity (using false means), the player inevitably passes through a field of delusions. If he sees his Dharma and recognizes that change is not only possible but necessary, he is ready to move on. But if he considers his vision of the world complete and complete, he will inevitably come back here again and again.

The number six consists of a combination of two odd or three even numbers (two triples or three twos), that is, from five possible elements. Therefore, it is in perfect balance. Six is associated with ingenuity, creativity and the fine arts. She is a representative of the lunar family of numbers and is associated with Venus. Venus is the brightest and most brilliant of the planets and can be seen with the naked eye as a morning star. In Hindu mythology, Venus (Shukra) is the teacher of demons. Those who live in illusion, love sensual pleasures, waste energy on satisfying desires, fall prey to anger and greed, act contrary to the laws of Dharma, are irreligious, and are terribly selfish.
